## No, but really...

## My Golang experience

.image img/wp.jpg 200 _

- dockerfiles
- private cloud
- separate inhouse admin / operator team

: good use of open-source tooling with custom procedures

## My Golang experience

.image img/getanna.png 200 _

- cheapest VPS from OVH (currently - 15zł / month)
- self-hosted everything
- CTO, backend dev, salesperson, operator, oncall, customer support, sales...
- wasted a ton of free GCP credits
- `nohup go run *.go &`

: hacky everything with a lot of faith and 24/7 having a computer on me
: also installed a terminal app for my phone to be able to restart the server on the go

## My Golang experience

.image img/tiktok.png 200 _

- kinda custom everything
- but some things were pretty cloud-standard
- who knows what falls under NDA?

: mix of both approaches mentioned above

: I still don't have a "be all-end all" solution
: instead, I approach each project with naivity of a junior engineer
: trying to understand what we need to do and why

## What is a web application?

.image img/google_network.png 400 _

- browser sends request
- server sends response
- browser interprets response

## HTML, CSS, JS...

.image img/google_response.png 300 _

- HTML defines structure
- CSS enhances visuals
- JS adds interactivity

\... unless you are a professional developer in 2022

: a lot of things are now done using various frameworks
: those frameworks offer different tradeoffs compared to "traditional" approaches
: impossible to "reverse-engineer" without serious knowledge and experience
: the basics are still the same - browsers send requests, servers send responses
:
: all of this doesn't matter if you're not working for a corporation, because the
: goals of those frameworks are largely irrelevant for small teams and small products

## Case study - creating your own blogging platform

## Defining your application MVP

- reachable by typing a human-readable string in the URL bar
: that's what the websites are for
- upgradable with or two scripts that don't require thinking for quick iteration
: otherwise no update will be done ever
- possible to add blog posts without restarting the server
: that's pretty basic for a blog platform
- access to metrics and logs
: for troubleshooting and inspection
- use the simplest deployment pipeline possible
: for educational purposes
- high score on pagespeed.web.dev
: a simple benchmark that I know is achieveable because Jacob Martin has done that https://jacobmartins.com/


: before you begin writing ANY application, you need to define what it should do
: there are two enemies you will face otherwise: no DoD and scope creep
: this means, you will never release your app ever

## "Feature creep" we "avoid"

- Pagination
- Image display
- Comments
- Admin panel
- Monetization
- User tracking
- Cookie / GDPR popups
- DDOS protection
- Reusing plugins from other creators
- SEO / SEM optimization
- Fault tolerance
- ...

## Product Mockup

.image img/mockup.jpg 400 _

: in a good company, you will get interactive mockups
: they should detail all wanted and unwanted interactions

: while it is not your responsibility as a software engineer to
: understand usability concerns or visual flair, you should at least
: be able to point out that a view from a mockup is unreachable

: because I have no product team, I have just drawn a quick mockup on a piece of paper with two possible interactions
: one for going to full article page

: can you spot an unreachable view?

## System Architecture

.image img/architecture.png

- keep the graphs simple
- rigid frameworks obfuscate ideas
- implementation details can usually be omitted

: the architecture is super simple
: we have a storage that holds our articles
: upon request to the main page, we will load a list of articles and their leads and display them to the user
: upon request to an article page, we will load the content of given article and show it to the user

## Our Frontend

.code staticarticles/articles/landing.html

: my frontend is quite simple, see "articles" folder
: contains HTML documents for landing.html (the landing page)
: and 3 articles named 1.html, 2.html and 3.html

## Our Backend (landing)

.code staticarticles/main.go /LANDINGSTART OMIT/,/LANDINGEND OMIT/

- match routing pattern
- read content from file
	- on error, log error message to standard output and return status code 500
- on success, write content as response

: to implement the backend, I have called http.HandleFunc four times
: one for landing and one for each article

## Our Backend

.code staticarticles/main.go /1START OMIT/,/1END OMIT/

- match routing pattern
- read content from file
	- on error, log error message to standard output and return status code 500
- on success, write content as response

## Our Backend

.code staticarticles/main.go /2START OMIT/,/2END OMIT/

- match routing pattern
- read content from file
	- on error, log error message to standard output and return status code 500
- on success, write content as response

## Our Backend

.code staticarticles/main.go /3START OMIT/,/3END OMIT/

- match routing pattern
- read content from file
	- on error, log error message to standard output and return status code 500
- on success, write content as response

## Our Backend

.code staticarticles/main.go /3START OMIT/,/3END OMIT/ HLchanges

Everything except those three lines stays the same.

## What is a function?

.image img/cleaning.png 500 _

.caption _gopher_performing_multiple_house_chores_at_the_same_time_watercolor_ by [[https://labs.openai.com/][DALL-E]]

: a function is a shortcut - for example, "clean a house" is a function
: that is invoked by a parent or partner and while it's specification is
: usually vague, there are parameters in form of available cleaning supplies
: and expected output of trash from your room and nice smell in the air

: what happens inside the function is called an "implementation detail"
: you can implement this function using an automated vacuum, employ a person
: or use your own manual labor to perform the task

## What is an interface?

.image img/interface.png 500 _

.caption _oil_painting_of_gopher_with_a_long_grey_beard_sitting_in_a_library_and_pondering_on_the_meaning_of_life_ by [[https://labs.openai.com/][DALL-E]]

: an interface is used to group functions together
: you can split or combine them together, to achieve the interface that you actually
: require

: for example:
: 	house cleaner interface for house cleaning
: 	party animal interface for partying

## What is a statically typed language?

.code dynamicarticles/main.go /ARTICLESTART OMIT/,/ARTICLEEND OMIT/

- there is technically no "fully dynamic typing" - you always expect something
- with statically typed language, you can enforce that expectation in code
- we will see "dynamically typed" content later

## Defining our interface

.code dynamicarticles/main.go /INTERFACESTART OMIT/,/INTERFACEEND OMIT/

## Static and dynamic content

*Dynamic content* - content that is created "on the fly".

*Static content* - content that is "self-contained", it doesn't rely on additional data.

- landing page is *dynamic* - we generate it using existing articles
- article page is *static* - we want to return a file from directory as-is

## Implementing the interface in pseudocode

	Article(id int) (Article, error)

- Convert id to string, add `.html` suffix constructing `<filename>`
- Load file from `articles/<filename>`
	- If the file does not exist, return an error
- Construct an `Article` struct from the file content
	- If file content is invalid, return an error
- Return the article with `nil` error

## Implementing the interface in pseudocode

	Articles() ([]Article, error)

- Start with an empty article list
- For each file in `articles` directory:
	- If the file doesn't have `.html` extension, ignore it and log this action
	- If the file does have `.html` extension:
		- Get `ID` parameter from filename
			- If filename cannot be converted to an integer, return an error
		- Get an article using `GetArticle` function from previous slide
			- If `GetArticle` returns an error, return an error
		- Add new article to our list of articles
- Return the list of articles with `nil` error

: this means our landing page will break if we put a badly-formatted .html file in our
: articles/ folder, but this is not a bug - it is a choice
: if you'd like to not return an error but instead log that there is an errornous
: file, you can do it - you are the boss

## Implementing the pseudocode in Go

.code dynamicarticles/filesystemstorage.go /LISTARTICLESSTART OMIT/,/LISTARTICLESEND OMIT/

- The filepath separator will not work on Windows
	- `os.PathSeparator` exists for a reason
- It doesn't matter, because we only want to deploy something usable
- Blackblox `Article(id)` call for now

## Implementing the pseudocode in Go

.code dynamicarticles/filesystemstorage.go /GETARTICLESTART OMIT/,/GETARTICLEEND OMIT/

- I assume that I will be able to construct an article from a file
- I can leave that as a "function" or "interface" and implement later
- Possibly changing the article file content as I see fit

## Constructing an article

.code dynamicarticles/filesystemstorage.go /CONSTRUCTARTICLESTART OMIT/,/CONSTRUCTARTICLEEND OMIT/

- Relies on structure of HTML document
	- This is the example of "dynamic typing" mentioned before
	- In dynamically typed language you just remember those assumptions
- I can implement it as badly as I want and fix it once it becomes a bottleneck

## Writing your own helper functions

.code dynamicarticles/filesystemstorage.go /STRINGBETWEENSTART OMIT/,/STRINGBETWEENEND OMIT/

If a function you need doesn't exist - it's ok to write your own extensions to standard library!

## Type assertion to get compiler feedback

.code dynamicarticles/filesystemstorage.go /TYPEASSERTIONSTART OMIT/,/TYPEASSERTIONEND OMIT/

I usually do this to have a highlight in my IDE when I'm not actually implementing the interface correctly

## Using interfaces to expand our program

.code dynamicarticles/loggingstorage.go

## You could actually do way less...

	go get github.com/go-chi/chi

- I will use https://github.com/go-chi/chi for:
	- easier pattern rules
	- `chi.URLParam` function to extract id
- It means I don't have to write my own HTTP path parsing
- You could use Firebase and only write the frontend
- You could use WordPress and just focus on the deployment
- You could use Medium and avoid any programming
- But then where are you going to start learning?

## You could also do way more

- Use bare C
- Setup private Kubernetes cluster on Raspberry Pi
- Support infinite horizontal scaling
- Write a custom recommendation engine
- Automatically add new posts to your Twitter / Facebook accounts

## Glueing it all together

.code dynamicarticles/main.go /MAINSTART OMIT/,/MAINEND OMIT/

## Returning a single article

.code dynamicarticles/main.go /GETARTICLEHANDLERSTART OMIT/,/GETARTICLEHANDLEREND OMIT/

## Landing template

.code dynamicarticles/main.go /TEMPLATESTART OMIT/,/TEMPLATEEND OMIT/

## Teaser template

.code dynamicarticles/main.go /TEASERSTART OMIT/,/TEASEREND OMIT/

At this point I suggest using `text/template` or `html/template` package.

## Returning list of articles

.code dynamicarticles/main.go /LISTARTICLESSTART OMIT/,/LISTARTICLESEND OMIT/

## Generating article URLs

.code dynamicarticles/main.go /ARTICLEURLSTART OMIT/,/ARTICLEURLEND OMIT/

- pretty URL generated for ✨aesthetic✨ purposes
- maybe also relevant for SEO, which is irrelevant to us

## The deployment itself

	scp * your_username@your_vps_ip
	ssh your_username@your_vps_ip
	go build -o blog
	nohup ./blog 1>stdout 2>stderr &

- simple - requires only go to be installed on the VPS
- copy-paste friendly
- no expectations, no guarantees
- you can improve your deployment pipeline from here once you encounter problems
- solve your problems with `sudo`, worst case scenario someone hacks your VPS and you recreate it
- still missing the DNS setup, but I'm still working on an in-depth article on it...
- default port for HTTP is 80, default port for HTTPS is 443

## bUt ThIs Is NoT bEsT pRaCtIcE!11!!!!!!11

.image img/nohup.jpg 200 _

- best practices become antipatterns
- actual best practices emerge from experimenting with mediocre practices
- in my opinion the best practice is a shipped, working product
- if you learn on each failure, you will discover it's possible to fail forward
- JUST PUBLISH YOUR CODE AND SEND THE APP TO YOUR FRIENDS FOR REVIEW
- wait for a crash, rinse, repeat
- you will learn to reject offers from bad companies hunting for code monkeys

## Google questions instead of answers

.image img/google_questions.png 400 _

- first article is about Heroku
- second and third are about Daemonizing your process
- fourth article is about deploying on Google Cloud

## Thank you for your attention!
